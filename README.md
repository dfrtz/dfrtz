# Software Engineer and ~~Addict~~ Enthusiast

### Welcome to my little neck of the woods, it's nice to meet you!

Whether it's professional or personal, I am passionate about software development and engineering.
I love exploring the physical and digital worlds, and bringing the imagination to life.
While most of my time is spent on closed source projects, I have a great appreciation for open source software
and the ideas they share with the world.

## What I Code With

Platforms that I love working with personally and professionally.
I also enjoy many other languages and frameworks not listed here, as they each have their own merits.
These are my current "daily drivers".

Favorite day-to-day software I use to create, collaborate, and simplify/automate tasks.
Always keep an extensive toolbox handy.

Development and engineering can be an addictive hobby, as I also enjoy Game Development, IoT/Home Automation,
building custom water-cooled PCs, and building Death Stars (3D modeling/printing).

## My Guidelines (mostly for development, but also life in general)

- **Always ask "What could go wrong?"**

  Take a close look at everything you do, and try to understand the impact it may have on others.
  Don't make someone else clean up your mess.


- **Sometimes it's okay to be a "Cowboy/Cowgirl"**

  When people are telling you "no", ask yourself: are they doing it selfishly, or are they thinking about others?
  At the end of the day, you answer to yourself, so if you are thinking about others, and it feels right, do it.


- **Take pride in everything**

  If you don't enjoy or take pride in what you are doing, you probably shouldn't do it. Do something else.
  Life is short.


- **Live like there is no tomorrow**

  Treat each day like it's your last, and leave the world in a better place than when you found it.
  Help encourage others to do good works, and continue yours where you leave off.
